# INTRODUCTION

Hey hello friends welcome to another post, In this article, I am going to introduce my newly design fully SMT components used 4 channel remotely and manually controlled homeAutomation PCB.
I have also made 8 channel SMT homeautomation PCB, TMT Components used homeautomation PCB.
This homeautoamtion PCB is very small in size and compact which can easily fits in your electrical switch boards.
This PCB has inbuilt OTA button, that is, you can update the code wirelessly over the air.
And there is two Onbaord Led’s which you could use according to your need like testing your code or something else.
In my case I have  used as WIFI indicator that is if WIFI connection is available then both the Led’s will glow else only single Led will glow.

By using this PCB, I will make a small homeautomation system that is internet and manual controlled homeautoamtion system using blynk iot plateform.
In this home-automation system we can control our home-appliances by using blynk smartphone application from anywhere in this world

Apart from this we can also control our home-appliances through manual switches that we generally use in our homes and we can also monitor the real-time status in the blynk smartphone application.
This PCB is compatible for all the smart speakers available in the market like Amazons Alexa , google home and Apples SIRI.
